## Opencv for Lazarus

This is slightly extended port of famous opencv library for Lazarus IDE.
http://www.lazarus-ide.org/

I take no credit for porting because most of porting work was created by people
who committed to:
(https://sourceforge.net/projects/opencv-delphi/)

Lazarus port (including demo1) was created and expanded by Giandomenico:
(http://gidesa.altervista.org/camshiftdemo.php)

Another changes introduced by Jurassic Pork are described here: http://forum.lazarus.freepascal.org/index.php?topic=31851.0

There is also great opencv port for Delphi:
https://github.com/Laex/Delphi-OpenCV
from which I took inspiration and source code too.

According to findings od @blaisexen ipl.pas and opencv.pas, originated from: https://github.com/arturobriones/EmbarcaderoXE3_OpenCV/tree/master/opencvdelphi

So most credit goes to all of them mentioned above.

If you want to try opencv with Lazarus here are bin files needed for opencv 2.4.12:
- 32bit.: http://uloz.to/xAquti2D/opencv2412-vs-32bit-rar
- 64bit.: http://uloz.to/xPq6wSNx/opencv-2412-64bit-rar
